# Orders Program

   This was the final project of the COBOL course work at Chubb Institute.  This program is just one part of 
   the entire project I wrote.  The JCL and database files are missing. 
   
   It does run as a batch job. A big challenge was that in the printed result the form was shifted and 
   was not aligning correctly. After many hours (days?) of detective work- it turned out that I was one
   byte off in the code.  
   
  Chubb Institute's program was 7 months; it focused on COBOL, CICS, JCL and DB2 but also included 
  classes in C++, MS Access and Visual Basic.
